This script is a simple website scanner that checks whether a list of URLs or a single URL contains a specified string. If a URL is found to contain the string, the script prints a message saying "found" and the URL. If a URL does not contain the string, the script prints a message saying "fail" and the URL. The script also provides the option to save the results to an output file and to only show positive results.
